## Question 4

Consider a probability density $p_x (x)$ defined over a continuous variable $x$, and suppose that we make a nonlinear change of variable using $x = g(y)$ so that the density transforms according to the formula:

### $$p_y (y) = p_x(g(y)) \ |g'(y)|$$

By differentiating the above formula, show that the location $\hat{y}$ of the maximum of the density in $y$ is not in general related to the location $\hat{x}$ of the maximum of the density over $x$ by the simple functional relation $\hat{x} = g(\hat{y})$ as a consequence of the Jacobian factor. This shows that the maximum of a probability density (in contrast to a simple function) is dependent on the choice of variable. Verify that, in the case of a linear transformation, the location of the maximum transforms in the same way as the variable itself.
