## **Question 1**:

Consider the sum-of-squares function given by 
### $$E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (y(x_n, \mathbf{w}) - t_n)^2$$
in which the function $y(x_n, \mathbf{w})$ is given by the polynomial
### $$\sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x_n^j.$$
Show that the coefficients $\mathbf{w} = \\{w_i\\}$ that minimizes this error function are given by the solution to the following set of linear equations:
### $$\sum_{j=0}^{M} A_{ij} w_j = T_i$$ 
where
### $$A_{ij} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (x_n)^{i+j}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ T_i = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (x_n)^i t_n$$
---
## **Solution**:

We find the minimum by setting the derivative of $E(\mathbf{2})$ with respect to all constants $w_i$ equal to zero. Since we have:
### $$E(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (\sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x^j - t_n)^2$$
### $$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_i} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (\sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x_n^j - t_n)x_n^i = 0$$
where $i = 0, 1, 2, ..., M$. By distributing $x_n^i$ we immediately get:
### $$\sum_{n=1}^{N} (\sum_{j=0}^{M} w_j x_n^{i + j}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_n^i t_n$$
By interchangingg sums and defining $A_{ij}$ and $T_i$ as in the question, we are done.
