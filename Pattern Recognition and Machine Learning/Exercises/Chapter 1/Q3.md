## **Question 3**:

Suppose that we have three coloured boxes $r$ (red), $b$ (blue), and $g$ (green). Box $r$ contains 3 apples, 4 oranges, and 3 limes, box $b$ contains 1 apple, 1 orange, and 0 limes, and box $g$ contains 3 apples, 3 oranges, and 4 limes. If a box is chosen at random with probabilities $p(r) = 0.2,\ p(b) = 0.2,\ p(g) = 0.6$, and a piece of fruit is removed from the box (with equal probability of selecting any of the items in the box), then what is the probability of selecting an apple? If we observe the selected fruit is in fact an orange, what is the probability that it came from the green box?

## **Solution**:

The probability of selecting an apple is given by:

$$P(\text{apple}) = P(\text{red})P(\text{apple}|\text{red}) + P(\text{blue})P(\text{apple}|\text{blue}) + P(\text{green})P(\text{apple}|\text{green}) = (0.2)(\frac{3}{3+4+3}) + (0.2)(\frac{1}{1+1+0}) + (0.6)(\frac{3}{3+3+4}) = 0.34$$

The probabiity that our picked fruit came from a green box given it is an orange is given by (Bayes' Theorem):
$$P(\text{green}|\text{orange}) = \frac{P(\text{green} \cap \text{orange})}{P(\text{orange})} = \frac{P(\text{green})P(\text{orange}|\text{green})}{P(\text{red})P(\text{orange}|\text{red}) + P(\text{blue})P(\text{orange}|\text{blue}) + P(\text{green})P(\text{orange}|\text{green})}$$

$$ = \frac{(0.6)(\frac{3}{3+3+4})}{(0.2)(\frac{4}{3+4+3}) + (0.2)(\frac{1}{1+1+0}) + (0.6)(\frac{3}{3+3+4})} = 0.5$$
